What's New in This Fork
=======================

This fork contains the Equinox Framework changes that I find useful but are missing from the original source code repository. These include:

* Builds nicely as part of eclipse-java8 project for Early Access to Eclipse Java 8.
* Compiles without errors with Java 8 Early Access.
* Compiles without errors with Java 7.
